My name is Aran Tang. I enjoy consuming all forms of entertainment such as books, movies, TV shows, and especially video games. 
I love eating food from a variety of cultures from all around the world. 
As a hobby, I enjoy making digital art and have mostly been self-taught.

I have volunteered at the East Brunswick Public Library and for East Brunswick Youth Council. I have over 50 hours of volunteer work.
